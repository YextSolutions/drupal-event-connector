# Product Description & Purpose

Power dynamic site search by syncing your Event Content Types from Drupal to Yext. Drupal is a free, open-source content management system with a large, supportive community. It is used by millions of people and organizations around the globe to build and maintain their websites. Each connector will pull in a different entity type, so you will have to download multiple if you would like to pull in different types such as Places, People, Articles, and Pages.

The Drupal Event Connector automatically syncs your Event data to Yext on a daily basis. Any time you add, update, or remove an Event content type in Drupal, these same changes will occur in Yext. Now you can extend the reach of your Drupal data even further to power Yext search experiences! 

This app uses the built-in Event entity type and creates the following custom fields: 
- drupalEvent\_drupalDescription

This app also adds a plugin, constructUrl.
